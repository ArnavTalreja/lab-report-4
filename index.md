# CLDQ - CSE LABS "DONE QUICK"
This lab report is all about speeding up our work on the command line. To do so, we'll be using a bunch of keyboard shortcuts and some built-in command
line functions to optimize our work flow on the command line. For the purpose of hands on learning, we'll be executing the commands on a sample repository `lab7`.\
For setup, we'll be forking the `lab7` repository to our GitHub account.\
Get the stopwatches out!
## 3... 2... 1... GO!
### 1. Logging into `ieng6` server
We start off by logging into our course specific server.

```bash
  Keys Pressed: <Control + R> "ssh" <enter>
```
For this, I used the history function. Typing out ssh brought up he login command right up and since I have the ssh passkey set, all I had to do was press `<enter>` and I was in. Pretty simple!
### 2. Cloning the repository
We then move on to cloning the repository onto the `ieng6` server.

```bash
  Keys Pressed: "git clo" <tab> <command + V>
```
For this, I simply typed out `"git clo"` before hitting the `<tab>` key and allowing bash to auto-complete the command for me. I then pressed `<command + V>` to paste the link to the `lab7` repository I had copied to the clipboard earlier.
